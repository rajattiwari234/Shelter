## Inspiration
During the covid-19 pandemic, the world got in chaos. It was so hard to put things in order which inspired us to make the shelter, we discovered a huge gap of interaction between donors and the needy.

## Objective
The purpose of the disaster management project “Shelter” is to ensure that an organization can respond to a disaster or other emergency that affects information systems and reduce the impact to a minimal cause.

## Project description
People are generally not prepared and unplanned for any disaster, be it an earthquake, tsunami, bush fire, etc. This website will help in providing training on do's and don'ts during a disaster to avoid any casualties. The platform will also provide the best evacuation and escape routes by providing a nearby place to live with medical and food assistance. This nonprofit organization "Shelter'', partnered with the city fire department, the local weather center, and other similar entities, prepares individuals for potential disasters and supports those who have been affected. We have added a Real-time chat app with WebSockets using Node.js, Express, and Socket.io with Vanilla JS on the front end with a custom UI to offer a platform to chat with people all over the globe who need any help, who wants to donate, or any other type of discussion.

## What it does
Suggests nearest location with shelter/food /medicine/ essential items Bridges the communication gap between persons Gives a platform to people to volunteer in every way (donors /volunteer )

## Challenges we ran into
This is the first hackathon that we are developing together. How to plan a project and complete it in a day. We used Figma for the first time. Creating wireframes with Figma was a little tough job but it feels a lot easier now.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
We have never used Pygame before, so developing an actual working thing in just two days makes us feel awesome. We are so proud of figuring out the Spritesheets and how to use them.

## What we learned
We learned to build a chat app with WebSockets using Node.js, Express and Socket.io with Vanilla JS on the frontend with a custom UI. This is the first hackathon that we are developing. We learned how to manage and build together to plan a project and complete it in a limited time period. We used Figma for the first time. Learning wireframes with Figma was also fun.

## What's next for Shelter
We will work for the betterment of the platform by working on its responsiveness and develop an easy pathway between the donor's and receiver's interface
